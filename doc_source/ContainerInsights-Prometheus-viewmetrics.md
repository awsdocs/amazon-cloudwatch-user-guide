# Viewing your Prometheus metrics<a name="ContainerInsights-Prometheus-viewmetrics"></a>

You can monitor and alarm on all your Prometheus metrics including the curated pre\-aggregated metrics from App Mesh, NGINX, Java/JMX, Memcached, and HAProxy, and any other manually configured Prometheus exporter you may have added\. For more information about collecting metrics from other Prometheus exporters, see [Tutorial for adding a new Prometheus scrape target: Prometheus API Server metrics](ContainerInsights-Prometheus-Setup-configure.md#ContainerInsights-Prometheus-Setup-new-exporters)\.

In the CloudWatch console, Container Insights provides the following pre\-built reports: 
+ For Amazon EKS and Kubernetes clusters, there are pre\-built reports for App Mesh, NGINX, HAPROXY, Memcached, and Java/JMX\.
+ For Amazon ECS clusters, there are pre\-built reports for App Mesh and Java/JMX\.

Container Insights also provides custom dashboards for each of the workloads that Container Insights collects curated metrics from\. You can download these dashboards from GitHub
