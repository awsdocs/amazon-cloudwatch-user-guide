# Add or remove a line widget on a CloudWatch dashboard<a name="add_remove_line_dashboard"></a>

 With the line widget, you can compare metrics over periods of time\. You also can use the widget's mini\-map zoom feature to inspect sections of line graphs without changing between zoomed\-in and zoomed\-out views\. The procedures in this section describe how to add and remove a line widget on a CloudWatch dashboard\. For information about using the widget's mini\-map zoom feature with line graphs, see [Zooming in on a line or stacked area graph](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/zoom-graph.html)\.
