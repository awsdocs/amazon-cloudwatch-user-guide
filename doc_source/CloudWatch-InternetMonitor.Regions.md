# Supported AWS Regions for Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor<a name="CloudWatch-InternetMonitor.Regions"></a>

The AWS Regions where Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor is supported are listed in this section\. For a current list of Regions that Internet Monitor is supported in, including opt\-in Regions, see [Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/cwim_region.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

For Internet Monitor, Regional support depends on the types of resources that you add to your monitor:
+ For Amazon CloudFront distributions and Amazon WorkSpaces directories, Internet Monitor is available in all the Regions listed here, with no special restrictions, including Regions listed for opt\-in support and for default support\.
+ For Amazon Virtual Private Clouds \(VPCs\), VPCs from an opt\-in Region can be added only to a monitor created in the same Region\. 

Note that Internet Monitor stores data for a monitor in only the AWS Region in which you create the monitor, although a monitor can include resources in multiple Regions\.
