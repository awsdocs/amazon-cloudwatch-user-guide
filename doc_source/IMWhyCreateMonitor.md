# Using an Internet Monitor monitor<a name="IMWhyCreateMonitor"></a>

There are several ways to use an Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor monitor after you create it: for example, you can view information in the CloudWatch dashboard, get information by using the AWS Command Line Interface, and set health alerts\.

Your monitor provides the information about your application and configuration preferences so that Internet Monitor can customizes measurements and metrics to publish for you\. Internet Monitor collects measurements from the global infrastructure footprint for AWS\. These measurements are a tremendous amount of network performance and availability information from all over the world\. By using information from the resources that you add for your application, Internet Monitor publishes performance and availability measurements for you that is scoped to the city\-networks \(that is, client locations and ASNs, typically internet service providers or ISPs\) where your application is active\. So, the measurements and metrics in the Internet Monitor dashboard and in CloudWatch Logs —about availability, performance, monitored bytes transferred, and round\-trip time—are specific to your client locations and ASNs\. 

Internet Monitor also determines when there are anomalies in performance and availability\. By default, Internet Monitor overlays your traffic with the availability and performance measurements that AWS has collected for each source\-destination pair in your client locations, to determine when there are notable drops in performance or availability\. When there's significant degradation for your application's locations and scope, Internet Monitor generates a *health event*, and publishes information about the issue to your monitor\.

After you create a monitor, you can use it to access or be alerted to the information that Internet Monitor provides, in the following ways:
+ **Use the CloudWatch dashboard** to view and explore performance, availability, and health events; explore your application's historical data; and get insights into new ways to configure your application for better performance\. To learn more, see the following:

  + [Getting insights to improve application performance in Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor \(Traffic insights tab\)](CloudWatch-IM-insights.md)
+ **Use AWS CLI commands** with Internet Monitor API actions to view traffic profile information, view measurements, list health events, and so on\. To learn more, see [Examples of using the CLI with Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor](CloudWatch-IM-get-started-CLI.md)\.
+ **Use standard CloudWatch tools,** such as CloudWatch Contributor Insights, CloudWatch Metrics explorer, and CloudWatch Logs Insights to visualize the data in CloudWatch\. To learn more, see [Viewing log files with CloudWatch tools](CloudWatch-IM-view-cw-tools.md)\.
+ **Use Athena with S3 logs** to access and analyze Internet Monitor internet measurements for your application, if you turned on publishing measurements to S3\.
+ **Create Amazon EventBridge notifications** to alert you when Internet Monitor determines there is a health event\. To learn more, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor with Amazon EventBridge](CloudWatch-IM-EventBridge-integration.md)\.
+ **Receive an AWS Health Dashboard notification** automatically, when Internet Monitor determines that an issue is caused by the AWS network\. The notification includes the steps that AWS is taking to mitigate the problem\.
