# Amazon EFS Metrics and Dimensions<a name="efs-metricscollected"></a>

Amazon EFS sends metrics to CloudWatch for every Amazon EFS file system every minute\. For more information, see [Monitoring Amazon EFS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/monitoring_overview.html) in the *Amazon Elastic File System User Guide*\.

## Amazon CloudWatch Metrics for Amazon EFS<a name="efs-metrics"></a>

The `AWS/EFS` namespace includes the following metrics\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| BurstCreditBalance |  The number of burst credits that a file system has\. Burst credits allow a file system to burst to throughput levels above a file system’s baseline level for periods of time\. For more information, see [Throughput scaling in Amazon EFS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#bursting)\. The `Minimum` statistic is the smallest burst credit balance for any minute during the period\. The `Maximum` statistic is the largest burst credit balance for any minute during the period\. The `Average` statistic is the average burst credit balance during the period\.  Units: Bytes Valid statistics: `Minimum`, `Maximum`, `Average`  | 
| ClientConnections |  The number of client connections to a file system\. When using a standard client, there is one connection per mounted Amazon EC2 instance\.  To calculate the average `ClientConnections` for periods greater than one minute, divide the `Sum` statistic by the number of minutes in the period\.  Units: Count of client connections Valid statistics: `Sum`  | 
| DataReadIOBytes |  The number of bytes for each file system read operation\. The `Sum` statistic is the total number of bytes associated with read operations\. The `Minimum` statistic is the size of the smallest read operation during the period\. The `Maximum` statistic is the size of the largest read operation during the period\. The `Average` statistic is the average size of read operations during the period\. The `SampleCount` statistic provides a count of read operations\. Units: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/efs-metricscollected.html) Valid statistics: `Minimum`, `Maximum`, `Average`, `Sum`, `SampleCount`  | 
| DataWriteIOBytes |  The number of bytes for each file write operation\. The `Sum` statistic is the total number of bytes associated with write operations\. The `Minimum` statistic is the size of the smallest write operation during the period\. The `Maximum` statistic is the size of the largest write operation during the period\. The `Average` statistic is the average size of write operations during the period\. The `SampleCount` statistic provides a count of write operations\. Units: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/efs-metricscollected.html) Valid statistics: `Minimum`, `Maximum`, `Average`, `Sum`, `SampleCount`  | 
| MetadataIOBytes |  The number of bytes for each metadata operation\. The `Sum` statistic is the total number of bytes associated with metadata operations\. The `Minimum` statistic is the size of the smallest metadata operation during the period\. The `Maximum` statistic is the size of the largest metadata operation during the period\. The `Average` statistic is the size of the average metadata operation during the period\. The `SampleCount` statistic provides a count of metadata operations\. Units: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/efs-metricscollected.html) Valid statistics: `Minimum`, `Maximum`, `Average`, `Sum`, `SampleCount`  | 
| PercentIOLimit | Shows how close a file system is to reaching the I/O limit of the General Purpose performance mode\. If this metric is at 100% more often than not, consider moving your application to a file system using the Max I/O performance mode\.  This metric is only submitted for file systems using the General Purpose performance mode\.  Units: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/efs-metricscollected.html)  | 
| PermittedThroughput |  The maximum amount of throughput a file system is allowed\. For file systems in the Provisioned Throughput mode, this value is the same as the provisioned throughput\. For file systems in the Bursting Throughput mode, this value is a function of the file system size and `BurstCreditBalance`\. For more information, see [Amazon EFS Performance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html)\. The `Minimum` statistic is the smallest throughput permitted for any minute during the period\. The `Maximum` statistic is the highest throughput permitted for any minute during the period\. The `Average` statistic is the average throughput permitted during the period\.  Units: Bytes per second Valid statistics: `Minimum`, `Maximum`, `Average`  | 
| TotalIOBytes |  The number of bytes for each file system operation, including data read, data write, and metadata operations\. The `Sum` statistic is the total number of bytes associated with all file system operations\. The `Minimum` statistic is the size of the smallest operation during the period\. The `Maximum` statistic is the size of the largest operation during the period\. The `Average` statistic is the average size of an operation during the period\. The `SampleCount` statistic provides a count of all operations\.  To calculate the average operations per second for a period, divide the `SampleCount` statistic by the number of seconds in the period\. To calculate the average throughput \(Bytes per second\) for a period, divide the `Sum` statistic by the number of seconds in the period\.   Units: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/efs-metricscollected.html) Valid statistics: `Minimum`, `Maximum`, `Average`, `Sum`, `SampleCount`  | 

## Dimensions for Amazon EFS Metrics<a name="efs-metric-dimensions"></a>

### Amazon EFS Dimensions<a name="efs-dimensions"></a>

Amazon EFS metrics use the `EFS` namespace and provides metrics for a single dimension, `FileSystemId`\. A file system's ID can be found in the Amazon EFS management console, and it takes the form of `fs-XXXXXXXX`\.
