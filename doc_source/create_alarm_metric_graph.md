# Create an alarm from a metric on a graph<a name="create_alarm_metric_graph"></a>

You can graph a metric and then create an alarm from the metric on the graph, which has the benefit of populating many of the alarm fields for you\.

**To create an alarm from a metric on a graph**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**\.

1. Select a metric namespace \(for example, **EC2**\) and then a metric dimension \(for example, **Per\-Instance Metrics**\)\.

1. The **All metrics** tab displays all metrics for that dimension in that namespace\. To graph a metric, select the check box next to the metric\.

1. To create an alarm for the metric, choose the **Graphed metrics** tab\. For **Actions**, choose the alarm icon\.

1. Under **Conditions**, choose **Static** or **Anomaly detection** to specify whether to use a static threshold or anomaly detection model for the alarm\.

   Depending on your choice, enter the rest of the data for the alarm conditions\.

1. Choose **Additional configuration**\. For **Datapoints to alarm**, specify how many evaluation periods \(data points\) must be in the `ALARM` state to trigger the alarm\. If the two values here match, you create an alarm that goes to `ALARM` state if that many consecutive periods are breaching\.

   To create an M out of N alarm, specify a lower number for the first value than you specify for the second value\. For more information, see [Evaluating an alarm](AlarmThatSendsEmail.md#alarm-evaluation)\.

1. For **Missing data treatment**, choose how to have the alarm behave when some data points are missing\. For more information, see [Configuring how CloudWatch alarms treat missing data](AlarmThatSendsEmail.md#alarms-and-missing-data)\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. Under **Notification**, select an SNS topic to notify when the alarm is in `ALARM` state, `OK` state, or `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state\.

   To have the alarm send multiple notifications for the same alarm state or for different alarm states, choose **Add notification**\.

   To have the alarm not send notifications, choose **Remove**\.

1. To have the alarm perform Auto Scaling or EC2 actions, choose the appropriate button and choose the alarm state and action to perform\.

1. When finished, choose **Next**\.

1. Enter a name and description for the alarm\. The name must contain only ASCII characters\. Then choose **Next**\.

1. Under **Preview and create**, confirm that the information and conditions are what you want, then choose **Create alarm**\.
