# Graphing Metrics Generated by Rules<a name="ContributorInsights-GraphReportData"></a>

Contributor Insights provides a metric math function, `INSIGHT_RULE_METRIC`\. You can use this function to add data from a Contributor Insights report to a graph in the **Metrics** tab of the CloudWatch console\. You can also set an alarm based on this math function\. For more information about metric math functions, see [Using Metric Math](using-metric-math.md)

To use this metric math function, you must be signed in to an account that has both the `cloudwatch:GetMetricData` and `cloudwatch:GetInsightRuleReport` permissions\.



The syntax is `INSIGHT_RULE_METRIC(ruleName, metricName)`\. *ruleName* is the name of a Contributor Insights rule\. *metricName* is one of the values in the following list\. The value of *metricName* determines which type of data the math function returns\.
+ `UniqueContributors` — the number of unique contributors for each data point\.
+ `MaxContributorValue` — the value of the top contributor for each data point\. The identity of the contributor might change for each data point in the graph\.

  If this rule aggregates by `Count`, the top contributor for each data point is the contributor with the most occurrences in that period\. If the rule aggregates by `Sum`, the top contributor is the contributor with the greatest sum in the log field specified by the rule's `Value` during that period\.
+ `SampleCount` — the number of data points matched by the rule\.
+ `Sum` — the sum of the values from all contributors during the time period represented by that data point\.
+ `Minimum` — the minimum value from a single observation during the time period represented by that data point\.
+ `Maximum` — the maximum value from a single observation during the time period represented by that data point\.
+ `Average` — the average value from all contributors during the time period represented by that data point\.

## Setting an Alarm on Contributor Insights Metric Data<a name="ContributorInsights-GraphReportData-Alarm"></a>

You can set alarms on metrics generated by Contributor Insights by using `INSIGHT_RULE_METRIC`\. For example, you can create an alarm based on the percentage of TCP connections that have been rejected\. First, create two rules like the following:

```
{
    "Schema": {
        "Name": "CloudWatchLogRule",
        "Version": 1
    },
    "LogGroupNames": [
        "/aws/containerinsights/sample-cluster-name/flowlogs"
    ],
    "LogFormat": "CLF",
    "Fields": {
        "3": "interfaceID",
        "4": "sourceAddress",
        "8": "protocol",
        "13": "action"
    },
    "Contribution": {
        "Keys": [
            "interfaceID",
            "sourceAddress"
        ],
        "Filters": [
            {
                "Match": "protocol",
                "EqualTo": 6
            },
            {
                "Match": "action",
                "In": [
                    "REJECT"
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    "AggregateOn": "Sum"
}
```

```
{
    "Schema": {
        "Name": "CloudWatchLogRule",
        "Version": 1
    },
    "LogGroupNames": [
        "/aws/containerinsights/sample-cluster-name/flowlogs"
    ],
    "LogFormat": "CLF",
    "Fields": {
        "3": "interfaceID",
        "4": "sourceAddress",
        "8": "protocol",
        "13": "action"
    },
    "Contribution": {
        "Keys": [
            "interfaceID",
            "sourceAddress"
        ],
        "Filters": [
            {
                "Match": "protocol",
                "EqualTo": 6
            }
    "AggregateOn": "Sum"
}
```

Then, in the **Metrics** tab on the console, create a graph with the following metric math expressions:

```
e1 INSIGHT_RULE_METRIC("RejectedConnectionsRule", "Sum")
e2 INSIGHT_RULE_METRIC("TotalConnectionsRule", "Sum")
e3 (e1/e2)*100
```

For more information about graphing metrics and using metric math functions, see [Adding a Math Expression to a CloudWatch Graph](using-metric-math.md#adding-metrics-expression-console)\.

In this example, the `e3` expression returns the percentage of connections that are rejected\. If you want to be notified when 20 percent of connections are rejected, you can set an alarm on that expression, setting **20** as the threshold\. To set an alarm on a metric you are viewing in the **Metrics** tab, choose the alarm icon in the row of the metric that you want to alarm on\. The alarm icon looks like a bell\.
