# Graph a metric<a name="graph_a_metric"></a>

You can select metrics and create graphs of the metric data using the CloudWatch console\.

CloudWatch supports the following statistics on metrics: `Average`, `Minimum`, `Maximum`, `Sum`, and `SampleCount`\. For more information, see [Statistics](cloudwatch_concepts.md#Statistic)\.

You can view your data at different levels of detail\. For example, you can choose a one\-minute view, which can be useful when troubleshooting\. Or, choose a less detailed, one\-hour view\. That can be useful when viewing a broader time range \(for example, 3 days\) so that you can see trends over time\. For more information, see [Periods](cloudwatch_concepts.md#CloudWatchPeriods)\.

If you are using an account that is set up as a monitoring account in CloudWatch cross\-account observability, you can graph metrics from the source accounts linked to this monitoring account\. For more information, see [CloudWatch cross\-account observability](CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account.md)\.

## Creating a graph<a name="create-metric-graph"></a>

**To graph a metric**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**, **All metrics**\.

1. In the **Browse** tab, enter a search term in the search field, such as a metric name, account ID, or resource name\.

   For example, if you search for the `CPUUtilization` metric, you see the namespaces and dimensions with this metric\.

1. Select one of the results for your search to view the metrics\.

1. To graph one or more metrics, select the check box next to each metric\. To select all metrics, select the check box in the heading row of the table\.

1. Choose **View graphed metrics**\.

1. \(Optional\) To change the statistic used in the graph, choose the new statistic in the **Statistic** column next to the metric name\.

   For more information about CloudWatch statistics, see [CloudWatch statistics definitions](Statistics-definitions.md)\. For more information about the **p*xx* percentile statistics, see [Percentiles](cloudwatch_concepts.md#Percentiles)\.**

1. \(Optional\) To change the type of graph, choose **Graph options**\. You can then choose between a line graph, stacked area chart, bar chart, pie chart, or number\.

1. \(Optional\) To add an anomaly detection band that shows expected values for the metric, choose the anomaly detection icon under **Actions** next to the metric\.   
![\[The metrics console, with the anomaly detection icon circled.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/Anomaly_Detection_Icon.PNG)

   CloudWatch uses up to two weeks of the metric's recent historical data to calculate a model for expected values\. It then displays this range of expected values as a band on the graph\. CloudWatch adds a new row under the metric to display the anomaly detection band math expression, labeled **ANOMALY\_DETECTION\_BAND**\. If recent historical data exists, you immediately see a preview anomaly detection band, which is an approximation of the anomaly detection band generated by the model\. It takes up to 15 minutes for the actual anomaly detection band to appear\.

   By default, CloudWatch creates the upper and lower bounds of the band of expected values with a default value of 2 for the band threshold\. To change this number, change the value at the end of the formula under **Details** for the band\.

   1. \(Optional\) Choose **Edit model** to change how the anomaly detection model is calculated\. You can exclude past and future time periods from being used in the training for calculating the model\. It is critical to exclude unusual events system as system outage, deployments, and holidays from the training data\. You can also specify the time zone to use for the model for daylight saving time changes\.

   For more information, see [Using CloudWatch anomaly detection](CloudWatch_Anomaly_Detection.md)\.

   To hide the model from the graph, remove the checkmark from the line with the ` ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND` function or choose the `X` icon\. To delete the model entirely, choose **Edit model**, **Delete model**\.

1. \(Optional\) As you choose metrics to graph, specify a dynamic label to appear on the graph legend for each metric\. Dynamic labels display a statistic about the metric, and automatically update when the dashboard or graph is refreshed\. To add a dynamic label, choose **Graphed metrics**, **Dynamic labels**\.

   By default, the dynamic values that you add to the label appear at the beginning of the label\. You can then choose the **Label** value for the metric to edit the label\. For more information, see [Use dynamic labels](graph-dynamic-labels.md)\.

1. To view more information about the metric being graphed, pause the mouse over the legend\.

1. Horizontal annotations can help graph users more efficiently see when a metric has spiked to a certain level, or whether the metric is within a predefined range\. To add a horizontal annotation, choose **Graph options** and then **Add horizontal annotation**:

   1. For **Label**, enter a label for the annotation\.

   1. For **Value**, enter the metric value where the horizontal annotation appears\.

   1. For **Fill**, specify whether to use fill shading with this annotation\. For example, choose `Above` or `Below` for the corresponding area to be filled\. If you specify `Between`, another `Value` field appears, and the area of the graph between the two values is filled\.

   1. For **Axis**, specify whether the numbers in `Value` refer to the metric associated with the left Y\-axis or the right Y\-axis, if the graph includes multiple metrics\.

      You can change the fill color of an annotation by choosing the color square in the left column of the annotation\. 

   Repeat these steps to add multiple horizontal annotations to the same graph\.

   To hide an annotation, clear the check box in the left column for that annotation\.

   To delete an annotation, choose **x** in the **Actions** column\.

1. To get a URL for your graph, choose **Actions**, **Share**\. Copy the URL to save or share\.

1. To add your graph to a dashboard, choose **Actions**, **Add to dashboard**\.

## Updating a graph<a name="update-metric-graph"></a>

**To update your graph**

1. To change the name of the graph, choose the pencil icon\.

1. To change the time range, select one of the predefined values or choose **custom**\. For more information, see [Modify the time range or time zone format for a graph](modify_graph_date_time.md)\.

1. To change the statistic, choose the **Graphed metrics** tab\. Choose the column heading or an individual value and then choose one of the statistics or predefined percentiles, or specify a custom percentile \(for example, **p95\.45**\)\.

1. To change the period, choose the **Graphed metrics** tab\. Choose the column heading or an individual value and then choose a different value\.

1. To add a horizontal annotation, choose **Graph options** and then **Add horizontal annotation**:

   1. For **Label**, enter a label for the annotation\.

   1. For **Value**, enter the metric value where the horizontal annotation appears\.

   1. For **Fill**, specify whether to use fill shading with this annotation\. For example, choose `Above` or `Below` for the corresponding area to be filled\. If you specify `Between`, another `Value` field appears, and the area of the graph between the two values is filled\.

   1. For **Axis**, specify whether the numbers in `Value` refer to the metric associated with the left y\-axis or the right y\-axis, if the graph includes multiple metrics\.

      You can change the fill color of an annotation by choosing the color square in the left column of the annotation\. 

   Repeat these steps to add multiple horizontal annotations to the same graph\.

   To hide an annotation, clear the check box in the left column for that annotation\.

   To delete an annotation, choose **x** in the **Actions** column\.

1. To change the refresh interval, choose **Refresh options** and then select **Auto refresh** or choose **1 Minute**, **2 Minutes**, **5 Minutes**, or **15 Minutes**\.

## Duplicating a metric<a name="duplicate-metric-graph"></a>

**To duplicate a metric**

1. Choose the **Graphed metrics** tab\.

1. For **Actions**, choose the **Duplicate** icon\.
