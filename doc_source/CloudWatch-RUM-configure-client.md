# Configuring the CloudWatch RUM web client<a name="CloudWatch-RUM-configure-client"></a>

Your applications can use one of the code snippets generated by CloudWatch RUM to install the CloudWatch RUM web client\. The generated snippets support two installation methods: as a JavaScript module through NPM, or from a content delivery network \(CDN\)\. For best performance, we recommend using the NPM installation method\. For more information about using this method, see [ Installing as a JavaScript Module](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-rum-web/blob/main/docs/npm_installation.md)\.

If you use the CDN installation option, ad blockers might block the default CDN provided by CloudWatch RUM\. This disables application monitoring for users who have ad blockers installed\. Because of this, we recommend that you use the default CDN only for initial onboarding with CloudWatch RUM\. For more information about the ways to mitigate this issue, see [ Instrument the application](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-rum-web/blob/main/docs/cdn_installation.md#instrument-the-application)\.

The code snippet sits in the `<head>` tag of an HTML file and installs the web client by downloading the web client, and then configuring the web client for the application it is monitoring\. The snippet is a self\-executing function which looks similar to the following\. In this example, the body of the snippet's function has been omitted for readability\.

```
<script>
(function(n,i,v,r,s,c,u,x,z){...})(
'cwr',
'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000',
'1.0.0',
'us-west-2',
'https://client.rum.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/1.0.2/cwr.js',
{ /* Configuration Options Here */ }
);
<script>
```

## Arguments<a name="CloudWatch-RUM-configure-client-arguments"></a>

The code snippet accepts six arguments:
+ A namespace for running commands on the web client, such as `'cwr'`
+ The ID of the app monitor, such as `'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'`
+ The application version, such as `'1.0.0'`
+ The AWS Region of the app monitor, such as `'us-west-2'`
+ The URL of the web client, such as `'https://client.rum.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/1.0.2/cwr.js'`
+ Application\-specific configuration options\. For more information, see the following section\.

## Ignoring errors<a name="CloudWatch-RUM-configure-ignore-errors"></a>

The CloudWatch RUM web client listens to all types of errors that happen in your applications\. If your application emits JavaScript errors that you do not want to view in the CloudWatch RUM dashboard, you can configure the CloudWatch RUM web client to filter out these errors so that you see only the relevant error events on the CloudWatch RUM dashboard\. For example, you might choose not to view some JavaScript errors in the dashboard because you have already identified a fix for them and the volume of these errors is masking other errors\. You might also want to ignore errors that you can't fix because they are owned by a library owned by a third party\.

For more information about how to instrument the web client to filter out specific JavaScript errors, see the example in [ Errors](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-rum-web/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#errors) in the web client Github documentation\.
