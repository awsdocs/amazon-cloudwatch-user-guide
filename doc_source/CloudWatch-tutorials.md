The following scenarios illustrate uses of Amazon CloudWatch\. In the first scenario, you use the CloudWatch console to create a billing alarm that tracks your AWS usage and lets you know when you have exceeded a certain spending threshold\. In the second, more advanced scenario, you use the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) to publish a single metric for a hypothetical application named *GetStarted*\.
