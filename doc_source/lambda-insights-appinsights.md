Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights helps you monitor your applications and identifies and sets up key metrics, logs, and alarms across your application resources and technology stack\. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights](cloudwatch-application-insights.md)\.

You can enable Application Insights to gather additional data from your Lambda functions\. If you haven't done this already, you can enable it by choosing **Auto\-configure Application Insights** in the **Application Insights** tab below the performance view in the Lambda Insights dashboard\.

If you have already set up CloudWatch Application Insights to monitor your Lambda functions, the Application Insights dashboard appears below the Lambda Insights dashboard, in the **Application Insights** tab\.
