**How to receive notification for problem events generated by an application**

From the CloudWatch console, select **Rules** under **Events** in the left navigation pane\. From the **Rules **page, select **Create rule**\. Choose **Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights** from the **Service Name** dropdown list and choose the **Event Type**\. Then, choose **Add target** and select the target and parameters, for example, an **SNS topic** or **Lambda function**\. 

**Actions through AWS Systems Manager\.** CloudWatch Application Insights provides built\-in integration with Systems Manager OpsCenter\. If you choose to use this integration for your application, an OpsItem is created on the OpsCenter console for every problem detected with the application\. From the OpsCenter console, you can view summarized information about the problem detected by CloudWatch Application Insights and pick a Systems Manager Automation runbook to take remedial actions or further identify Windows processes that are causing resource issues in your application\.
