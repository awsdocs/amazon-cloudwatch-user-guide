## CloudWatch Agent Command Line Parameters<a name="CloudWatch-Agent-options-help"></a>

To see the full list of parameters supported by the CloudWatch agent, type the following at the command line at a computer where you have it installed:

```
amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -help
```

## Installing the CloudWatch Agent Using Run Command Fails<a name="CloudWatch-Agent-installation-fails"></a>

To install the CloudWatch agent using Systems Manager Run Command, the SSM Agent on the target server must be version 2\.2\.93\.0 or later\. If your SSM Agent is not the correct version, you may see errors that include the following messages:

```
no latest version found for package AmazonCloudWatchAgent on platform linux
```

```
failed to download installation package reliably
```

For information about updating your SSM Agent version, see [Installing and Configuring SSM Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html)\.

## The CloudWatch Agent Won't Start<a name="CloudWatch-Agent-troubleshooting-cannot-start"></a>

If the CloudWatch agent fails to start, there might be an issue in your configuration\. Configuration information is logged in the **configuration\-validation\.log** file\. This file is located in `/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/logs/configuration-validation.log` on Linux servers, and in `$Env:ProgramData\Amazon\AmazonCloudWatchAgent\Logs\configuration-validation.log` on servers running Windows Server\.

## Verify That the CloudWatch Agent is Running<a name="CloudWatch-Agent-troubleshooting-verify-running"></a>

You can query the CloudWatch agent to find whether it is running or stopped\.

You can use AWS Systems Manager to do this remotely\. You can also use the command line, but only to check the local server\.

**To query the status of the CloudWatch agent using Run Command**

1. Open the Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Run Command**\.

   \-or\-

   If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens, scroll down and choose **Explore Run Command**\.

1. Choose **Run command**\.

1. In the **Command document** list, choose **AmazonCloudWatch\-ManageAgent**\.

1. In the **Target** area, choose the instance to check\.

1. In the **Action** list, choose **status**\.

1. Leave **Optional Configuration Source** and **Optional Configuration Location** blank\.

1. Choose **Run**\.

If the agent is running, the output resembles the following:

```
{
       "status": "running",
       "starttime": "2017-12-12T18:41:18",
       "version": "1.73.4"
}
```

If the agent is stopped the `"status"` field displays `"stopped"`\.

**To query the status of the CloudWatch agent locally using the command line**
+ On a Linux server, type the following:

  ```
  sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -m ec2 -a status
  ```

  On a server running Windows Server, type the following in PowerShell as an administrator:

  ```
  & $Env:ProgramFiles\Amazon\AmazonCloudWatchAgent\amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl.ps1 -m ec2 -a status
  ```

## Where Are the Metrics?<a name="CloudWatch-Agent-troubleshooting-no-metrics"></a>

If the CloudWatch agent has been running but you cannot find metrics collected by it in the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI, confirm that you are using the correct namespace\. By default the namespace for metrics collected by the agent is `CWAgent`\. You can customize this namespace using the **namespace** field in the **metrics** section of the agent configuration file\. If you do not see the metrics that you expect, check the configuration file to confirm the namespace being used\.

When you first download the CloudWatch agent package, the agent configuration file is `amazon-cloudwatch-agent.json`\. This file is located in the directory where you ran the configuration wizard, or you may have moved it to a different directory\. If you use the configuration wizard, the agent configuration file output from the wizard is named `config.json`\. For more information about the configuration file, including the **namespace** field, see [ CloudWatch Agent Configuration File: Metrics Section](CloudWatch-Agent-Configuration-File-Details.md#CloudWatch-Agent-Configuration-File-Metricssection)\. 

## Agent Won't Start and the Error Mentions an Amazon EC2 Region<a name="CloudWatch-Agent-troubleshooting-EC2-region"></a>

If the agent does not start and the error message mentions an Amazon EC2 Region endpoint, you may have configured the agent to need access to the Amazon EC2 endpoint without granting that access\.

For example, if you specify a value for the `append_dimensions` parameter in the agent configuration file that depends on Amazon EC2 metadata, and you use proxies, you must make sure that the server can access the endpoint for Amazon EC2\. For more information about these endpoints, see [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ec2_region) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

## Unable to Find Credentials on Windows Server<a name="CloudWatch-Agent-troubleshooting-Windows-credentials"></a>

On Windows Server, if you have credentials in a location other than `$SystemDrive\\Users\\Administrator\\.aws` on Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2012, or `“$SystemDrive\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\.aws` on Windows Server 2003, you can specify your own credential path by using the `shared_credential_file` option in `common.toml`\.

 If you don’t have a credential file, you must create one\. For more information, see [Modify the Common Configuration and Named Profile for CloudWatch Agent](install-CloudWatch-Agent-on-first-onprem.md#CloudWatch-Agent-profile-first)\.

## CloudWatch Agent Files and Locations<a name="CloudWatch-Agent-files-and-locations"></a>

The following table lists the files installed by and used with the CloudWatch agent, along with their locations on servers running Linux or Windows Server\.

## Logs Generated by the CloudWatch Agent<a name="CloudWatch-Agent-troubleshooting-loginfo"></a>

The agent generates a log while it runs\. This log includes troubleshooting information\. This log is the **amazon\-cloudwatch\-agent\.log** file\. This file is located in `/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/logs/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.log` on Linux servers, and in `$Env:ProgramData\Amazon\AmazonCloudWatchAgent\Logs\amazon-cloudwatch-agent.log` on servers running Windows Server\.

You can configure the agent to log additional details in the **amazon\-cloudwatch\-agent\.log** file\. In the agent configuration file, in the **agent** section, set the **debug** field to **true**, then reconfigure and restart the CloudWatch agent\. To disable the logging of this extra information, set the **debug** field to **false** reconfigure and restart the agent\. For more information, see [ Manually Create or Edit the CloudWatch Agent Configuration File](CloudWatch-Agent-Configuration-File-Details.md)\.

## Stopping and Restarting the CloudWatch Agent<a name="CloudWatch-Agent-troubleshooting-stopping-restarting"></a>

You can manually stop the CloudWatch agent using either AWS Systems Manager or the command line\. When you stop it manually, you also prevent it from automatically starting at the system reboot\.

**To stop the CloudWatch agent using Run Command**

1. Open the Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Run Command**\.

   \-or\-

   If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens, scroll down and choose **Explore Run Command**\.
