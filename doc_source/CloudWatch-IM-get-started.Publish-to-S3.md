# Publishing internet measurements to Amazon S3 in Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor<a name="CloudWatch-IM-get-started.Publish-to-S3"></a>

You can choose to have Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor publish internet measurements to Amazon S3 for your internet\-facing traffic to the monitored city\-networks \(client locations and ASNs, typically internet service providers\) in your monitor, up to the 500,000 city\-networks service limit\. Internet Monitor automatically publishes internet measurements to CloudWatch Logs every five minutes for the top 500 \(by traffic volume\) city\-networks for each monitor\. Measurements that it publishes to S3 include the top 500 that are published to CloudWatch Logs\.

You can choose the option to publish to S3 and specify the bucket to publish the measurements to when you create or update your monitor\. The bucket must already be created in S3 before you can specify it in Internet Monitor\. There's a service limit of 500,000 city\-networks for internet measurements published to S3\. Internet Monitor publishes internet measurements to S3 as events, a series of compressed log file objects that are stored in the bucket\.

When you create the S3 bucket for Internet Monitor to publish measurements to, make sure that you follow the permissions guidance provided by CloudWatch Logs\. Doing so ensures that Internet Monitor can publish logs directly to S3, and that AWS can, if needed, create and change the resource policies associated with the log group receiving the logs\. For details and more information, see [ Logs sent to CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AWS-logs-and-resource-policy.html#AWS-logs-infrastructure-CWL) in the Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide\.

The published log files are compressed\. If you open the log files using the Amazon S3 console, they are decompressed and the internet measurement events are displayed\. If you download the files, you must decompress them to view the events\.

You can also query the internet measurements in the log files using Amazon Athena\. Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easier to analyze data in Amazon S3, by using standard SQL\. For more information, see [Using Amazon Athena to query internet measurements in Amazon S3 log files](CloudWatch-IM-view-cw-tools.S3_athena.md)\.
