# Set up FireLens to send logs to CloudWatch Logs<a name="deploy-container-insights-ECS-logs"></a>

FireLens for Amazon ECS enables you to use task definition parameters to route logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log storage and analytics\. FireLens works with [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) and [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/)\. We provide an AWS for Fluent Bit image, or you can use your own Fluent Bit or Fluentd image\. Creating Amazon ECS task definitions with a FireLens configuration is supported using the AWS SDKs, AWS CLI, and AWS Management Console\. For more information about CloudWatch Logs, see [ What is CloudWatch Logs?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html)\.

There are key considerations when using FireLens for Amazon ECS\. For more information, see [ Considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_firelens.html#firelens-considerations)\.

To find the AWS for Fluent Bit images, see [ Using the AWS for Fluent Bit image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/firelens-using-fluentbit.html)\.

To create a task definition that uses a FireLens configuration, see [ Creating a task definition that uses a FireLens configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/firelens-taskdef.html)\.

**Example**

The following task definition example demonstrates how to specify a log configuration that forwards logs to a CloudWatch Logs log group\. For more information, see [What Is Amazon CloudWatch Logs?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide*\.

In the log configuration options, specify the log group name and the Region it exists in\. To have Fluent Bit create the log group on your behalf, specify `"auto_create_group":"true"`\. You can also specify the task ID as the log stream prefix, which assists in filtering\. For more information, see [Fluent Bit Plugin for CloudWatch Logs](https://github.com/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-logs-for-fluent-bit/blob/mainline/README.md)\.
